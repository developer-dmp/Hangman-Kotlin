# Hangman-Kotlin
Simple implementation of the classic game Hangman, in Kotlin<br>
This was my introduction project to Kotlin!

## Implementation
Program reads text file - each line contains one word<br>
Program prompts user for difficulty - easy, medium, hard<br>
Program continues to prompt the user for a letter to guess<br>
Program determines what to do with the guessed letter<br>
At game end, notify the user if they won or lost<br>

## Future Iterations
Adding email component at the game end<br>
Make word file more robust so there could be a category for each word<br>
Enhanced GUI
